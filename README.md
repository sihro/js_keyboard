technologies used: HTML+CSS+javaScript

All project is one HTML page(just run it)


ONLY one keyboard supported, but presents ability to easily support ANY skins and ANY keyboard layouts - 
needs to reimplements methods:  getSrc(id), getBtns(id) to return skin and layout.
(This data should be received in future using API calls to remote server)

keyboard works ONLY when input is in focus.

keyboard can print to input(english lower-case letters only - because you can click only ONE key at once? and caps_lock support not implemented.)
